# Python
Contains projects and practice related to Python Bootcamp


So, I am going to start learning Python now bc it is in huge demand and I figured big firms or be it any firm won't give me a job unless I am technically very strong. 

I have created my first branch 'Python Practice' where I will test and verify my code and then finally, I will commit it to the master branch. 

Note: Github: basically keeps track of all the changes you made to your code. It is a version tracking system.
